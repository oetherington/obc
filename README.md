# OBC

OBC is a B compiler for i386 and x86-64 written in C.

OBC compiles directly from source code to machine code without any intermediate
representation or assembler. I aim to keep the source code of OBC (at least
reasonably) easy to read and understand, but it's not quite didactic.

OBC is free software under the GNU GPLv3.
